# Git Commit Preferences

## Commit Message Format

When creating git commits, do NOT include:
- "🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)" footer
- "Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>" attribution

Keep commit messages clean with just the conventional commit format and description.
